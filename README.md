# üí´  Hi there, I'm Patrycja!

üî≠ **I‚Äôm currently working on** : Expanding my skills as a student at Code Institute, focusing on building dynamic, full-stack web applications using Django REST Framework and React.  I'm also constantly looking for ways to enhance my coding abilities and work on real-world projects.<br><br>üëØ **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on** : Beginner to intermediate-level web development projects, especially those involving Django and full-stack technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and back-end tools such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, and APIs. I'm keen to work with others to create practical, user-friendly applications while learning as much as I can along the way.<br><br>ü§ù **I‚Äôm looking for help with** : Gaining more hands-on experience with complex back-end functionalities in Django and understanding how to create smooth, scalable REST APIs. Any tips on combining front-end and back-end seamlessly would be awesome!<br><br>üå± **I‚Äôm currently learning** : Deep diving into Django REST framework and React. These technologies are teaching me a lot about creating robust, scalable web applications. Always open to learning something new!<br><br>üí¨ **Ask me about** : My journey from learning English as a second language to diving into tech, how I'm balancing coursework with real-world projects, or anything about starting out in full-stack development. I‚Äôm happy to share my experience as a student and aspiring web developer.<br><br>‚ö° **Fun fact** : I was born in Poland, and English is my second language! Learning to code while mastering a second language has been quite a challenge, but it‚Äôs also given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and communication.<br><br>
