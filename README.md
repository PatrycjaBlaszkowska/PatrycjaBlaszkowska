# 💫 Hi there, I'm Patrycja!

🔧 **Graduate Full-Stack Developer | Aspiring IT & Network Technician**

🌐 You can see my [Personal Portfolio](patrycjablaszkowska.github.io) here!

🎓 **Education & Current Focus**  

I’m a **graduate of the Code Institute Full-Stack Software Development programme**, where I built and deployed multiple real-world web applications using Python, Django, JavaScript, and relational databases.

I’m currently expanding my skill set by studying the **Cisco Network Technician Path**, developing a stronger understanding of networking, infrastructure, and how software operates within real systems and environments.

---

🔭 **What I’m working on now**  
- Strengthening practical networking knowledge (TCP/IP, routing, switching, network security)  
- Applying computing fundamentals beyond code — systems, infrastructure, and security  
- Continuing to improve and maintain my full-stack projects  
- Building a broader **applied computing** skill set that combines development, data, networking, and IT operations  

---

👯 **Open to collaboration on**  
- Full-stack or backend-focused web applications  
- Projects involving APIs, databases, or system integration  
- Beginner to intermediate projects related to **networking, security, or IT support tools**  
- Practical projects that follow real-world development and deployment workflows  

---

🤝 **Currently interested in learning more about**  
- Networking concepts and troubleshooting  
- Secure system design and access control  
- How backend systems interact with infrastructure  
- Applying **project management principles** to technical work  

---

🌱 **Continuous learning**  
- Cisco Network Technician Path  
- Django REST Framework & API architecture  
- Security best practices in web and networked systems  
- Data handling and analysis using Python  

---

💬 **Ask me about**  
- Transitioning from full-stack development into broader applied computing and networking  
- Building projects from concept to deployment  
- Studying tech while working independently on real-world skills  
- Learning tech as a non-native English speaker

⚡ **Fun fact**  

I was born in Poland 🇵🇱 and English is my second language.  
Learning to code and work with technical documentation in a second language has strengthened my attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
