# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi there, I'm Patrycja!<br>🔭 I’m currently working on: Expanding my skills as a student at Code Institute, focusing on building dynamic, full-stack web applications using Django REST Framework and React. I'm also constantly looking for ways to enhance my coding abilities and work full time as a office administrator.<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Beginner to intermediate-level web development projects, especially those involving Django, React, or REST APIs. I'm keen to work with others to create practical, user-friendly applications while learning as much as I can along the way.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking for help with: Gaining more hands-on experience with complex back-end functionalities in Django and understanding how to create smooth, scalable REST APIs. Any tips on combining front-end and back-end seamlessly would be awesome!<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning: Deep diving into Django REST framework and React. These technologies are teaching me a lot about creating robust, scalable web applications. Always open to learning something new!<br><br>💬 Ask me about: My journey from learning English as a second language to diving into tech, how I'm balancing coursework with real-world projects, or anything about starting out in full-stack development. I’m happy to share my experience as a student and aspiring web developer.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I was born in Poland, and English is my second language! Learning to code while mastering a second language has been quite a challenge, but it’s also given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and communication.<br><br>🌐 Connect with me:
